### ðŸ†” Friendly Prefixed IDs for your Ruby on Rails models

[![Build Status](https://github.com/excid3/prefixed_ids/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/excid3/prefixed_ids/actions) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/prefixed_ids.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/prefixed_ids)

Generate prefixed IDs for your models with a friendly prefix. For example:

```ruby
user_12345abcd
acct_23lksjdg3
```

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
bundle add 'prefixed_ids'
```

## Usage

First, you'll need to generate a migration to add the prefix_id column to your model(s).

```ruby
class AddPrefixIdToUsers< ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_index :users, :prefix_id, unique: true
  end
end
```

It's important the `prefix_id` column is indexed and unique.

Then you can add `has_prefix_id :my_prefix` to your models to autogenerate prefixed IDs.

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_prefix_id :user
end
```

This will generate a value like `user_1234abcd` in the User's `prefix_id` column.

### Customizing

You can customize the prefix, length, and attribute name for PrefixedIds.

```ruby
class Account < ApplicationRecord
  has_prefix_id :acct, attribute: :my_id, length: 32
end
```
